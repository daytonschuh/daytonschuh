<h3 align="center">I graduated from California State University, Fullerton with my bachelor's degree in computer science.
My obsession with video games led me to where I am now -- a software developer passionate about making life simple and fun.
I have a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow, but that's the best part!</h3>
